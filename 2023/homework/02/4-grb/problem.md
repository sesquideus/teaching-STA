A telescope is constructed to look for gamma ray bursters (GRBs). Given that GRBs can appear from any direction,
i.e. are isotropically distributed in the sky,

a.  What is the prior probability distribution that a GRB will be seen at a particular declination $\delta$?

    _Hint: consider the fraction of the sky at this declination._

a.  If $\mu = \sin \delta$, show that the prior for $\mu$ is uniform for $-1 < \mu < 1$.
