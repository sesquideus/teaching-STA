We just plug in the values and obtain
$$
    t_0 =
    \frac{\Mean{x} + \num{7.7}}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} =
    \frac{\num{-7.5} + \num{7.7}}{\num{1.1} / \sqrt{148}} \doteq
    \num{2.21} > \num{1.96}.
$$

Therefore we **reject** $H_0$: the difference between the _claimed mean_ of
$\num{7.7}$ and the _observed mean_ of $\num{7.5}$ is statistically significant
even at $\qty{5}{\percent}$ level.
