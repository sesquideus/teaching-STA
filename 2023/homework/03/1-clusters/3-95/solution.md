In the standard normal distribution

![](normal.gp){height=60mm}

we need to find the value of $Z_{\alpha / 2}$ such that the area _outside_ the interval
$\IntervalCC{-Z_{\alpha / 2}}{Z_{\alpha / 2}}$ is equal to $\alpha = \num{0.05}$.
Or conversely, that the area _within_ the interval is $1 - \alpha = \num{0.95}$.

We have calculated this result previously, it happens for $Z_{\alpha / 2} \doteq \num{1.96}$.
Therefore we reject $H_0$ if and only if $\Abs{T_0} > \num{1.96}$.
