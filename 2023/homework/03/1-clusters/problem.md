The distribution of absolute magnitudes of globular clusters in the Milky Way is **claimed**
to be well described by a Gaussian distribution with **mean** $\mu = \qty{-7.7}{\mag}$.

Astronomers observe $n = 148$ Galactic globular clusters with absolute magnitudes $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$
and find a **sample** mean of $\Mean{x} = \qty{-7.5}{\mag}$
with sample variance of $s^2 = \left(\qty{1.1}{\mag}\right)^2$.
