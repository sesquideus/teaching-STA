Since $H_a$ is obviously two-sided, we shall use the standard normal distribution
with $t_0 \equiv \dfrac{\Abs{\Mean{x} - \mu_0}}{s / \sqrt{n}}$.

The $p$-value is then
$$
    p = P \left((T_0 < -t_0) \Text{or} (T_0 > +t_0)\right),
$$
which is, for the symmetric standard normal distribution, equal to
$$
    p = 2P \left(T_0 > t_0\right).
$$
