Radio astronomers have measured fluxes of $n = 386$ positions on the sky
where optical galaxies are located (sample `G`) as well as $m = 290$ random
positions in the sky (sample `R`). The tabulated data give for both samples the number of positions
in bins of fluxes $x$ (which can be both negative and positive due to noise),
i.e. radio flux densities.

Using the **Kolmogorov--Smirnov two-sample test (KS)**, we want to test whether the `G`
sample has excess flux densities as argued by the astronomers.
