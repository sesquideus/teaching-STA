While our own Milky Way is surrounded by about 200 dense stellar clusters known as globular clusters,
this number can increase to thousands in case of massive elliptical galaxies.
In all galaxies, the luminosities $X$ of these globular clusters follow a **lognormal distribution**
$$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{x \sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp{\left[-\frac{\left(\ln x - \mu\right)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right]}
$$
with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
