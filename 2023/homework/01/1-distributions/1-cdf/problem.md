A random variable $X$ has a probability distribution function (PDF) given by
$$
    f(x) = c / x^2
$$
on the interval $\IntervalCC{1}{2}$ and zero elsewhere.

a.  determine for which value of $c$ the corresponding cumulative distribution
    function $F(x)$ is correctly normalised;
a.  calculate the probability
    $$
        P(X \leq \num{1.5});
    $$
a.  infer the so-called first and third quartile values of $x$, for which respectively
    $$
        P(X \leq x) = \num{0.25} \QQText{and} P(X \leq x) = \num{0.75};
    $$
a.  using the definition of expectation of $g(x)$,
    $$
        \Expected{g(x)} = \Int[-\infty][\infty]{g(x)f(x)}{x}
    $$
    derive the mean and variance of $X$.
